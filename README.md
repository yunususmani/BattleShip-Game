# BattleShip-Game

BattleShip is a turn-based two-player game that simulates a war between ships on an ocean.
Each player gets their own battle area with a certain number of ships placed in non-overlapping positions. The ships
might be of different sizes. Note, players cannot see each others ship's location.
There are two types of ships - type P and type Q. Type P ships can be destroyed by a single hit in each of their cells
and type Q ships require 2 hits in each of their cells.
A ship is considered destroyed when all of its cells are destroyed.
The player who destroys all the ships of the other player first wins the game. The game ends in a draw if none of the
players can destroy all of the otherâ€™s ships using a finite number of missiles.
